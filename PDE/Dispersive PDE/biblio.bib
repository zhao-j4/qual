 abstract = {It is proved that certain convolution inequalities are easy consequences of the Hardy-Littlewood-Wiener maximal theorem. These inequalities include the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality for fractional integrals, its extension by Trudinger, and an interpolation inequality by Adams and Meyers. We also improve a recent extension of Trudinger's inequality due to Strichartz.},

 abstract = {We prove an abstract Strichartz estimate, which implies previously unknown endpoint Strichartz estimates for the wave equation (in dimension n ≥ 4) and the Schrödinger equation (in dimension n ≥ 3). Three other applications are discussed: local existence for a nonlinear wave equation; and Strichartz-type estimates for more general dispersive equations and for the kinetic transport equation.},

abstract = {Let T be a bounded linear, or sublinear, operator from Lp(Y) to Lq(X). A maximal operator T*f(x)=supj|T(f·χYj)(x)| is associated to any sequence of subsets Yj of Y. Under the hypotheses that q>p and the sets Yj are nested, we prove that T* is also bounded. Classical theorems of Menshov and Zygmund are obtained as corollaries. Multilinear generalizations of this theorem are also established. These results are motivated by applications to the spectral analysis of Schrödinger operators.}
