 abstract = {We give a new proof of the global stability of Minkowski space originally established in the vacuum case by Christodoulou and Klainerman. The new approach, which relies on the classical harmonic gauge, shows that the Einstein-vacuum and the Einstein-scalar field equations with asymptotically flat initial data satisfying a global smallness condition produce global (causally geodesically complete) solutions asymptotically convergent to the Minkowski space-time.},
