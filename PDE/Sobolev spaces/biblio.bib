 abstract = {It is proved that certain convolution inequalities are easy consequences of the Hardy-Littlewood-Wiener maximal theorem. These inequalities include the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality for fractional integrals, its extension by Trudinger, and an interpolation inequality by Adams and Meyers. We also improve a recent extension of Trudinger's inequality due to Strichartz.},
